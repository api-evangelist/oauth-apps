# oAuth Application Setup
This is a list of walk throughs for setting up OAuth applications across a variety of platforms. I found myself having to walk people through the setup of applications for a variety of Postman collections I was creating, so I decided to centralize the walk throughs, reuse across the Postman collections, and reference these walk throughs in stories I tell.

Here are the OAuth Application setup process for the following platforms:

- [Twitter](twitter.md)
- [Salesforce](salesforce.md)

If there is an OAuth you'd like to see added to this list go ahead and submit a GitHub issue for this repository and I will consider added it to my queue of projects to tackle.
